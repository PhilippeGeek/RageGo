/**
 * The class compute data by the influence algorithm.
 * This is not that : :!!!!!
 * <h2>The Influence Algorithm</h2>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Let (m, n) be the coordinates of the influence source and (i, j) the coordinates of a an intersection being
 * visited during propagation, using the same notation as in the accumulate_influence() function. Influence is now
 * propagated to its eight closest neighbors, including the diagonal ones, according to the follow scheme:</p>
 * <p>For each of the eight directions (di, dj), do:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Compute the scalar product di*(i-m) + dj*(j-n) between the vectors (di,dj) and (i,j) - (m,n)</li>
 * <li>If this is negative or zero, the direction is not outwards and we continue with the next direction.
 * The exception is when we are visiting the influence source, i.e. the first intersection, when we spread
 * influence in all directions anyway.</li>
 * <li>If (i+di, j+dj) is outside the board or occupied we also continue with the next direction.</li>
 * <li>Let S be the strength of the influence at (i, j). The influence propagated to (i+di, j+dj) from this
 * intersection is given by P*(1/A)*D*S, where the three different kinds of damping are:
 * <li>The permeability ‘P’, which is a property of the board intersections. Normally this is one, i.e. unrestricted
 * propagation, but to stop propagation through e.g. one step jumps, the permeability is set to zero at such
 * intersections through pattern matching. This is further discussed below.</li>
 * <li>The attenuation ‘A’, which is a property of the influence source and different in different directions.
 * By default this has the value 3 except diagonally where the number is twice as much. By modifying the attenuation
 * value it is possible to obtain influence sources with a larger or a smaller effective range.</li>
 * <li>The directional damping ‘D’, which is the squared cosine of the angle between (di,dj) and (i,j) - (m,n).
 * The idea is to stop influence from "bending" around an interfering stone and get a continuous behavior at the
 * right angle cutoff. The choice of the squared cosine for this purpose is rather arbitrary, but has the advantage
 * that it can be expressed as a rational function of ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘di’, and ‘dj’, without involving any trigonometric
 * or square root computations. When we are visiting the influence source we let by convention this factor be one.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Influence is typically contributed from up to three neighbors "between" this intersection and the influence
 * source. These values are simply added together. As pointed out before, all contributions will automatically have
 * been made before the intersection itself is visited.</p>
