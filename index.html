<p>RageGo : Role-play and Aesthetic Game Engine for Go</p>

<h1>
<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h1>

<p>RageGo is an application which aims to revive the ancient game of Go by adding an adventurous RPG twist to it.
The aim is not only to implement a traditional WeiQi (other name for the game) but to create a universe around it, with
an interesting storyline so that the player may enjoy discovering the principles and background of the game while
being able to see his progress through the RPG side of the thing.</p>

<p>The player incarnates a young thief who goes in the spirit world to steal a powerful artifact (yet unknown) from the
dragon people. He thus triggers their anger, and they will stop at nothing to prevent him from getting out this parallel
dimension alive. But dragons are no savages, and rather than simply go and chop his head off, they decide to challenge
him to the game of Go. If he succeeds at beating them all, he will be allowed to return safely, with the artifact.</p>

<p>--&gt; Game modes</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skirmish (Main Feature)
The player will be able to train against spirits AI or already vanquished enemies
This mode will allow us to develop the Go Game Engine, test the AI, and create the GUI.
It is the most critical feature, as all others will be built from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Adventure/Story (Second Main Feature)
Allows the player to live the story built for the game and chose his path to earn his freedom back.(Details to be added)
This mode is supposed to be implemented as soon as the Skirmish mode is ready enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Tutorial (Secondary Feature)
Permits to learn the basics of Go playing with exercises to understand the rules and underlying principles
This will be implemented before creating the AI, as an exercise to familiarize with the use of the engine and thus ease
the implementation of the AI.</p></li>
<li><p>Online Mode (Stretch Goal)
Allows multiplayer play and possible exchanges between players.
Will only be implemented if described above features are so.</p></li>
