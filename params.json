He thus triggers their anger, and they will stop at nothing to prevent him from getting out this parallel\r\ndimension alive. But dragons are no savages, and rather than simply go and chop his head off, they decide to challenge\r\nhim to the game of Go. If he succeeds at beating them all, he will be allowed to return safely, with the artifact.\r\n\r\n# Gameplay\r\n\r\n--> Game modes\r\n\r\n- Skirmish (Main Feature)\r\nThe player will be able to train against spirits AI or already vanquished enemies\r\nThis mode will allow us to develop the Go Game Engine, test the AI, and create the GUI.\r\nIt is the most critical feature, as all others will be built from it.\r\n\r\n- Adventure/Story (Second Main Feature)\r\nAllows the player to live the story built for the game and chose his path to earn his freedom back.(Details to be added)\r\nThis mode is supposed to be implemented as soon as the Skirmish mode is ready enough.\r\n\r\n- Tutorial (Secondary Feature)\r\nPermits to learn the basics of Go playing with exercises to understand the rules and underlying principles\r\nThis will be implemented before creating the AI, as an exercise to familiarize with the use of the engine and thus ease\r\nthe implementation of the AI.\r\n\r\n- Online Mode (Stretch Goal)\r\nAllows multiplayer play and possible exchanges between players.\r\nWill only be implemented if described above features are so.","google":"UA-60747348-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
